You’re too sharp… you’re too talented for this to be what people know you as. This is what 100,000 people are going to know you as. As the cheater from Schooled. It’s how it works on the internet.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ludwig-2-1024x575.jpg><p>“The pocket that you live in — they don’t care… but your talents reach beyond that in my mind. It’s a bummer that hundreds of thousands of people will never give you an opportunity because you’ll always be just a cheater.” Ludwig said</p><p>EEvisu later on had apologised publicly on Twitter and the $50,000 cash prize was passed on to <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=twitch.tv/extraemily rel="noreferrer noopener">ExtraEmily </a>who was in second place initially.</p><p><strong>Also Read : </strong><a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://firstsportz.com/esports-news-top-5-most-watched-streamers-on-twitch-april-2022/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Top 5 Most Watched Streamers on Twitch April 2022</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xKynqKqkqHqvsdasZKWtlKy2qHnDnp2eppSoeqax1aKqrmWRm8Gmvoycn56ZpJ67qHnSnJinnJGheqq6jKirpKtdqLCpu86lnJ1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
