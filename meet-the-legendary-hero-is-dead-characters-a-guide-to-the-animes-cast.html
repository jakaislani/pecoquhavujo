He is a simple and honest farmer who lives in a small village with his parents and his pig. He is also a pervert who has a crush on his childhood friend Yuna. One day, he accidentally kills the legendary hero Sion Bladan, who was passing by his village, with a pit trap that he dug to catch demons. Anri Haysworth, the necromancer partner of Sion, transfers Touka’s soul into Sion’s corpse and forces him to pretend to be the hero. Touka reluctantly agrees, hoping to return to his normal life as soon as possible. However, he soon discovers that he has inherited Sion’s powers and responsibilities, and that he is the only one who can stop the Demon King from resurrecting.</p><p>Sion Bladan was the legendary hero who sealed the Demon King and his army at Hell’s Gate 10 years ago. He was revered and feared by many people, as he was the strongest and most ruthless warrior in the world. He was also a kind and gentle person who cared deeply for his friends and allies, especially Anri. He suffered from a lot of trauma and guilt due to the horrors he witnessed and caused during his journey.
