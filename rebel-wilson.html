Her career began with hilarious performances onstage and on television in Australia. She broke out in the United States with the 2011 blockbuster Bridesmaids as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/kristen-wiig data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kristen Wiig" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kristen Wiig</a>'s roommate. Portraying boisterous singing coed Fat Amy in the Pitch Perfect films made her an even bigger star, leading to a gig hosting the 2013 MTV Music Awards and a lead role in a short-lived 2013 television series Super Fun Night. Wilson later starred in films like Isn't It Romantic, The Hustle and Cats.</p><img alt="SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA - JUNE 14: Rebel Wilson arrives at 'Bridesmaids' Celebrity Girls Night Out to celebrate the Australian premiere at Event Cinemas George Street on June 14, 2011 in Sydney, Australia.

Wilson was an absolute scene-stealer with antics like explaining how she mistook her roommate's diary for a "sad handwritten book."</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Pitch Perfect' Franchise</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The starlet soon found herself along big-name Hollywood types in such movies as Bachelorette (2012), Struck by Lightning (2012), What To Expect When You're Expecting (2012) and Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012). Those led to her shining moment in the 2012 musical comedy Pitch Perfect with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/anna-kendrick data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Anna Kendrick" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Anna Kendrick</a>. Her role as choir-singing coed Fat Amy demanded plenty of physical comedy in addition to delivering unforgettable lines like "You guys are gonna get pitch-slapped so hard, your man boobs are gonna concave."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The success of the comedy fueled production of its sequels, with Wilson reprising her role of Fat Amy in Pitch Perfect 2 in 2015 and the franchise's third installment in 2017.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wilson appeared alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/mark-wahlberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mark Wahlberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mark Wahlberg</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/dwayne-johnson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dwayne Johnson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dwayne Johnson</a> in the action comedy Pain & Gain in 2013.

And her charisma on the silver screen led to a hosting at the 2013 MTV Movie Awards.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Super Fun Night'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wilson's ability to keep up with A-list actors in her back-to-back roles on film didn't go unnoticed. In October of 2013, she took on the lead role in the series Super Fun Night, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/conan-obrien data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Conan O'Brien" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Conan O'Brien</a> acting as the executive producer. After a rocky start — the pilot episode was scrapped after it received unfavorable reviews, which led to the show premiering with its second episode — the series premiere garnered more than 8 million viewers and was the No. 2 show among 18-49 year olds for the night. However, the series didn't hold up with critics or audiences as it continued, and it was canceled at the end of season.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2014, she appeared in another comedic role as Tilly, a museum security guard in Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'How to Be Single' and 'Isn't It Romantic'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wilson went on to star in the 2016 comedy How to Be Single with Leslie Mann and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/dakota-johnson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dakota Johnson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dakota Johnson</a>. She also teamed up with comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, Isla Fisher and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/penelope-cruz data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Penelope Cruz" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Penelope Cruz</a> for The Brothers Grimsby that year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In early 2019, Wilson starred in Isn't It Romantic as an architect who wakes up to find herself stuck in a storyline straight out of the romantic-comedy handbook. Along with her Pitch Perfect colleague Adam DeVine, the film featured <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/liam-hemsworth data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Liam Hemsworth" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Liam Hemsworth</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/priyanka-chopra data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Priyanka Chopra" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Priyanka Chopra</a> as the outrageously beautiful love interests.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Hustle' and 'Cats'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wilson has also been involved in behind-the-scenes efforts by way of her Camp Sugar Productions. Its first project was a remake of the 1988 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/steve-martin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steve Martin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Steve Martin</a>-Michael Caine comedy Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, which became The Hustle and earned its release in May 2019 with Wilson and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/anne-hathaway data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Anne Hathaway" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Anne Hathaway</a> in starring roles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In December 2019, the actress appeared alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/judi-dench data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Judi Dench" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Judi Dench</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/james-corden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="James Corden" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">James Corden</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/taylor-swift data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Taylor Swift" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Taylor Swift</a> and other stars in a film adaptation of the Broadway musical Cats, as the nocturnally inclined Jennyanydots.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Defamation Suit with Bauer Media</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around the time of Pitch Perfect 2's release, Wilson found herself in the middle of a media maelstrom over her age. An Australian publication presented information that she was, in fact, a few years older than she claimed to be. Her real birth date was later confirmed to be March 2, 1980, which meant she was actually 35 years old, according to People magazine. Wilson took to Twitter to make light of the controversy, writing "I'm actually a 100 year old mermaid formerly known as 'CC Chalice.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, Wilson took the series of articles — which were run by Bauer Media — seriously, as they claimed she had lied about her age and other biographical information. She sued the media company for defamation, saying it portrayed her as a "serial liar" and consequently prevented her from getting roles in Hollywood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2017, Wilson won her suit and was granted $4.5 million in damages, making her case the most successful defamation case in Australia. However, Bauer Media appealed and in June 2018, the appeals court sided with the company, which argued that Wilson had no proof her fiscal livelihood actually suffered as a result of the articles. The court reduced the damages compensation to $600K.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Regardless of the slight turn of events, Wilson said she felt vindicated and planed on giving the money to charity.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Other Projects</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wilson isn't just an actress; she could be a legal eagle. She attended law school as a backup plan to performing. In addition, she served as a Jenny Craig spokesperson in Australia and launched a cheeky plus-sized fashion line in 2013. Her label, "Fat Mandi," first consisted of T-shirts with cupcakes and doughnuts strategically placed across the wearer's chest. In 2015, Wilson collaborated with Torrid stores to launch another plus-sized clothing line.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Comedic actress Rebel Melanie Elizabeth Wilson, born on March 2, 1980, in Sydney, Australia, didn't have the most conventional childhood. Her parents were professional dog handlers. The family constantly traveled across the country to sell canine products from a caravan, a lifestyle Wilson later compared to carnie life. Surprisingly, Wilson was a shy kid but great at people-watching, which helped her develop her comedy later on.</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Acting in Australia</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating from the University of New South Wales, Wilson went to South Africa as an Australian youth ambassador, where she contracted malaria. She claims that during a fever-induced hallucination, she saw herself winning an Academy Award and took it as a sign to act.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wilson studied at the Australian Theatre for Young People and became known for creating and starring in her own comedy theater productions. Her screen debut happened down under in the series Pizza (2003) as a girl gang leader. More television as well as film work followed in her homeland. Eventually, Wilson won a scholarship with The Second City Training Centre and moved to New York City.</p><ul data-node-id=41 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Rebel Wilson</li><li>Birth Year: 1980</li><li>Birth date: March 2, 1980</li><li>Birth City: Sydney</li><li>Birth Country: Australia</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Australia's Rebel Wilson is best known for her funny roles, including Kristen Wiig's roommate in 'Bridesmaids' and the character Fat Amy in the 'Pitch Perfect' films.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Film</li><li>Comedy</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Pisces</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>University of New South Wales</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=44><ul data-node-id=46 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Rebel Wilson Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actors/rebel-wilson</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: March 9, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=49 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Even when I'm playing someone named Fat Amy, I'm all about confidence and attitude.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwvsSbnKVlp565tLvN</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
