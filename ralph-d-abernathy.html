Abernathy?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ralph D. Abernathy was a Baptist minister who, with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/martin-luther-king-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Luther King Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Luther King Jr.</a>, organized the historic Montgomery bus boycotts. He co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was a major civil rights figure, serving as a close adviser to King and later assuming SCLC presidency.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Abernathy was born on March 11, 1926, in Linden, Alabama, the 10th of 12 offspring born to Louivery Abernathy and William Abernathy, a farmer and deacon. Upon graduating from high school, Abernathy was drafted into the U.S. Army during <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World War II" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">World War II</a>, subsequently leaving his family's 500-acre farm.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following his military service, in 1948, Abernathy became an ordained minister while pursuing his education. He earned a mathematics degree from Alabama State College in 1950, and received a master's degree in sociology from Atlanta University the following year. He then became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Montgomery and dean of students at Alabama State. He also married Juanita Odessa Jones; the two would have four children together.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Close Allies With Martin Luther King Jr.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1954, when King became a minister at a nearby church, Abernathy mentored him. The two formed an incredible bond and would become leaders of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="civil rights movement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">civil rights movement</a>. In 1955, the pair founded the Montgomery Improvement Association and organized a yearlong bus boycott. Their actions were triggered by the arrest of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/rosa-parks data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rosa Parks" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rosa Parks</a>, who had refused to give up her bus seat to a white man. The boycott caught the country's attention but also brought violence; Abernathy's home and church were damaged by bomb blasts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The danger didn't deter Abernathy. In 1957, he and King helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the most prominent of the civil rights organizations in the south. King was president and Abernathy eventually became vice president. A few years later, Abernathy hosted a rally for the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/news/freedom-riders-route-civil-rights-map data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Freedom Riders" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Freedom Riders</a>, Black and White activists who traveled by bus to protest segregation in the South.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Later that year, when King took his civil rights efforts to Atlanta, Abernathy followed, working at the West Hunter Street Baptist Church. The two activists continued to organize protests, sit-ins and marches. Abernathy was arrested with King 17 times and was always by King's side, including when the civil rights leader was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Abernathy worked to keep King's spirit alive and became president of the SCLC. He also spearheaded the Poor People's Campaign of 1968, which included a march on Washington that led to the creation of the Federal Food Stamps Program.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death and Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1977, Abernathy relinquished his role as SCLC president and ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. After failing to be elected, he focused on his work as a minister and speaker. In 1989, his autobiography And the Walls Came Tumbling Down was published.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Abernathy died on April 17, 1990, in Atlanta, Georgia. He'll always be remembered as King's closest confidante and second in command. In fact, King himself said in his last speech, "Ralph David Abernathy is the best friend that I have in the world."</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=22 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Ralph David Abernathy</li><li>Birth Year: 1926</li><li>Birth date: March 11, 1926</li><li>Birth State: Alabama</li><li>Birth City: Linden</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Ralph D.
