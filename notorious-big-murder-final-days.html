According to Vibe, he spent much of the day with his agent, Phil Casey, discussing plans for an upcoming tour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Itching to get out, the rapper convinced his boys to head to an industry party at the Petersen Automotive Museum in the Miracle Mile district, co-sponsored by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/quincy-jones data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Quincy Jones'" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Quincy Jones'</a> Vibe magazine. As Combs later recounted, attending a Jones party on the outskirts of Beverly Hills seemed a safe enough move.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And for a while, it was. Although several known gang members had managed to infiltrate the guest list, the overall vibe was said to be a happy one. Wallace drank Dom Perignon with his crew and soaked in the adulation alongside fellow artists like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/aaliyah data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Aaliyah class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Aaliyah</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/missy-elliott data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Missy Elliott" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Missy Elliott</a>, the speakers pounding out "Hypnotize" every 10 minutes or so.

"I told him I wanted to be like him. He was so cool, so funny and calm."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, the venue soon became a little too cramped and at around 12:30 am, the fire department shut down the festivities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><strong>[<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://watch.aecrimecentral.com/specials/biggie-the-life-of-notorious-b-i-g data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Watch Biggie: The Life of the Notorious B.I.G." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Watch Biggie: The Life of the Notorious B.I.G.</a> on A&E Crime Central.]</strong></p><img alt="Notorious B.I.G. performing at Madison Square Garden for Urban Aid on October 5, 1995" title="Notorious B.I.G. performing at Madison Square Garden for Urban Aid on October 5, 1995" width=4227 height=3295 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/madison-square-garden-photo-of-notorious-big-notorious-big-performing-at-madison-sq-garden-for-urban-aid-on-10-5--1995-photo-by-david-corioredferns.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Biggie Smalls. performing at Madison Square Garden for Urban Aid on October 5, 1995.; Photo: David Corio/Redferns</span></p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The rapper was ambushed at a red light</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wallace and Combs trickled out with the rest of the partygoers, pausing to pose for pictures before cranking up a car stereo to blast some tracks from Life After Death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Deciding to head back to their hotel, Combs jumped into the first of three cars with several bodyguards. Wallace settled into the front passenger seat of the second, a Green GMC Suburban, next to his driver, Gregory "G-Money" Young, with two more friends in the back.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Combs' lead SUV promptly blew through a yellow light, leaving Wallace's group idling at the intersection of Wilshire Blvd and Fairfax Ave. Suddenly, a white Toyota Land Cruiser made a U-turn and tried to squeeze in the space behind the Green Suburban.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At that moment, a dark Chevy Impala pulled up next to Wallace. The driver, an African American man in a blue suit and a bowtie, made eye contact with the rapper, before reaching over and emptying his automatic pistol at the car.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Amid the commotion – the shots were fired mere yards from the crowd outside the museum – the shooter sped off on Wilshire. Meanwhile, Combs abandoned his SUV and raced across the street to the Green Suburban, where he found his friend hunched over, his tongue out, and bleeding on the dashboard.</p><img alt="The Clinton Hill neighborhood where the rap star Christopher Wallace grew up, comes out to watch his funeral procession drive by on March 18, 1997, in the Brooklyn." title="The Clinton Hill neighborhood where the rap star Christopher Wallace grew up, comes out to watch his funeral procession drive by on March 18, 1997, in the Brooklyn." width=5373 height=3599 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/biggie-smalls-was-murdered-while-visiting-los-angeles-after-a-long-feud-between-east-coast-and-west-coast-rappers-photo-by-andrew-lichtensteincorbis-via-getty-images.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">The Clinton Hill neighborhood where the rap star Christopher Wallace grew up, comes out to watch his funeral procession drive-by on March 18, 1997, in Brooklyn.; Photo: Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">He died shortly afterward despite near-immediate medical attention</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A driver floored it to the nearby Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where six people managed to lift the almost 400-pound rapper onto a gurney and send him in for emergency surgery. But despite the quick medical attention, the four bullets had already done their fatal damage, and 24-year-old Wallace was pronounced dead at 1:15 a.m.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At a time when his family, friends and associates expected to be celebrating another milestone, they instead found themselves processing his stunning loss. One week after Wallace's March 18 funeral, Life After Death debuted to great acclaim, en route to a spot among the top-selling rap albums in history.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wallace's murder sparked a controversial investigation and a wrongful death suit filed by his mother against the city, but, as with Shakur's, it remains unsolved, a sad reminder of the artist's noble but unsuccessful attempt to end the violence before it made him a victim.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiaq6Gdmnyvu9OoqaKnpah6o7XGZqSuqpSav26yyKeYpWWUlsa0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
