Fast forward 300 years later to 1993, and the Sanderson Sisters are accidentally resurrected from the dead on Halloween, thanks to a tie-dyed hippie teen named Max who's accompanied by his little sister and the girl of his dreams, Allison. The three of them, along with the immortal talking black cat Thackery, take on the witches and their evil spells to save the town of Salem.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although Hocus Pocus wasn't a big box office draw and was panned by critics, the film managed to take on a second life (and a sequel)—just like the Sanderson Sisters. Over time it gained cult status. Let's check out where the cast members are today.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Bette Midler (Winnie Sanderson)</h2><img alt="Bette Midler Photo" title="Bette Midler Photo" width=3000 height=1688 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/_bette-midler-attends-the-2017-new-york-restoration-project-spring-picnic-at-sherman-creek-park-on-june-19-2017-in-new-york-city-photo-by-mike-pont_wireimage.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Bette Midler; Photo: Mike Pont/WireImage</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After portraying bucktoothed witch Winnie — the eldest Sanderson Sister and the only one with a brain — Bette Midler continued being the major multi-hyphenate star that she is. With multiple Golden Globes, Emmys, Grammys and a Tony to her name, Midler continued her winning streak post-Hocus Pocus with memorable films like The First Wives Club (1996) and Parental Guidance (2012). On television, she had an Emmy-winning turn as a guest star on Murphy Brown in 1998 and over the years, has produced a variety of studio albums and headlined a slew of concert tours. In fact, Midler dressed as her witch character on her Divine Intervention Tour in 2015, singing "I Put a Spell on You," a track from the movie. Most recently, Midler received a Tony Award for her work on Broadway's revival of Hello, Dolly!.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Kathy Najimy (Mary Sanderson)</h2><img alt="Kathy Najimy Photo" title="Kathy Najimy Photo" width=3000 height=1687 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kathy-najimy-attends-build-series-presents-at-build-studio-on-april-21-2017-in-new-york-city-photo-by-santiago-felipe_filmmagic.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Kathy Najimy; Photo: Santiago Felipe/FilmMagic</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After saying "sorry" a million times with her crooked mouth and sniffing out children as middle sister Mary Sanderson, Kathy Najimy has found continued success in film and television. Since Hocus Pocus, she's starred in Rat Race (2001), Disney's Descendants (2015) and has lent her voice to a variety of animation projects including Stuart Little: The Animated Series, WALL-E and King of the Hill. On the small screen, Najimy has starred on Ellen, Chicago Hope, Veronica's Closet, The Big C, Veep and many more.

Besides her most famous role as Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City, Parker has had an impressive array of film credits to her name, including Ed Wood (1994), The First Wives Club (1996), The Family Stone (2005) and Did You Hear About the Morgans?
