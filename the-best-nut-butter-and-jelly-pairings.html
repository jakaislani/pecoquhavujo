It is in fact, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">peanut butter jelly</a> time. Or peanut butter and jam time. Or other nut butters and jelly time. The amount of possibilities and pairings is truly infinite but today we are here to give you what we think are some of the best nut butter and jelly pairings out there. First up…</p><strong>and</strong><p>This pairing is super intentional. Strawberry jam has a less strong and overpowering flavor than grape jelly and almond butter is notoriously a bit less flavorful than peanut butter (yes, we know that is a high bar). So, if you want to taste both the nut butter and the jelly but you don’t want plain ol’ PB and grape J, this pairing is a great way to do so. Plus, this from Walmart is actually pretty flavorful and delicious, and its sweet and salty creaminess pairs beautifully with the deep, rich, complex fruit flavor of (our favorite strawberry jam), which Danny Palumbo said tastes like “strawberry preserves made by a grandmother.”</p><p><strong>Read the full rankings of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best almond butter</a> and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best strawberry jam</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peanut Butter</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grape Jelly</a></strong><p>Now, this nut butter and jelly pairing is the classic, and while the author of this article may have called it things like “plain” and “ol’” in the previous paragraph, don’t worry, she is stupid and doesn’t know what she’s talking about. This is a thing for a reason. The strong nuttiness and savory notes of the peanut butter with sweet, tangy, and fruity grape jelly will literally never go out of style. Plus we have found you the ideal PB & the ideal J to use in your future PB&J pursuits: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Welch’s Natural Concord Grape Spread</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JIF Creamy Peanut Butter</a>. This PB is simply the best (we now know why choosy mom’s made a point of choosing this one in those old commercials), and the Welch’s grape spread is not only divine, it also comes in a “big ol’ squeeze bottle” for ease of jellification and fewer dishes. Go get both of these and increase your quality of life.</p><p><strong>Read the full rankings of the best <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">peanut butter</a> and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best grape jelly</a></strong></p><strong>Pistachio Butter and Raspberry Jam</strong><p>I feel like this would be extremely tasty. In my very professional opinion, raspberry jam is the most complex and delicious of the jams, and pistachios are one of the most desserty-tasting nuts (besides peanuts). I mean, they put it in so many ice creams, y’all. So my thought here is that if you made a sandwich with pistachio butter and raspberry jam and threw some choccy chips up in there, it would basically be spumoni (I realize spumoni is strawberry and not raspberry, but I think the raspberry flavor would hold up better here). Point is, if you want to make a homemade spumoni <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Uncrustables</a> (and I really really do), this is how one would do it.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is the Difference Between Jelly and Jam, Actually?</a></strong></p><strong>Cookie Butter and Cherry Jam</strong><p>What I am going for with this pairing is “pie that is technically a sandwich and therefore acceptable to eat for lunch.” Imagine cherry jam (which tastes suspiciously like cherry pie filling sometimes) and cookie butter (which is literally <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">smashed up cookies, oil, flour and sugar</a>) together, forever. This is essentially a cookie crust, cherry filling pie except with a pillowy, creamy texture and sandwiched between pillowy clouds of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">white bread</a>. Is this insane? Maybe. So insane it just might work? Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I Can’t Control Myself Around Cookie Butter</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peanut Butter</a> and Nutella</strong><p>Hear me out: In a peanut butter Nutella sandwich, Nutella is the jelly. It just is. Why? because it has just as much sugar and only slightly more nuts than the average jam or jelly out there, so I think it should count. That being said, this pairing is a classic. It’s like an overwhelmingly sweet and creamy Reese’s peanut butter cup that is (again) socially acceptable to eat anytime and anywhere due to the between-two-slices-of-bread nature of the ingredients. It is a cheat code for life, really: but anything between two slices of bread and suddenly everyone around you and you yourself can pretend it has some good ol’ nutritional value and isn’t just one of the most delicious things a person can make for themselves when they crave sugar and chocolate at 1:37 a.m.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is Nutella Actually Made of?</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKyYmnqjsdKtZKetpGKvtsDTnqlmmZ6Zequxy6WwZqiRnr%2BqusasZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
