Suffering from a mysterious illness since April 11 of this year — when he reportedly suffered complications from a medical procedure while filming the Netflix action-comedy Back in Action — Foxx has been out of the spotlight and seemingly in hiding for the past three months. During this time, fans have been left to speculate on his condition and prognosis.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=135 data-current-count=135 data-injectable=false>Last night, Foxx took to Instagram to shed some light on his condition, and to thank people for their kind words, prayers, and concern.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jamie Foxx (@iamjamiefoxx)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>Foxx seemingly admitted that the reports of him being “out of the hospital for weeks” and “playing pickle ball” were untrue, but stated by his daughter to allay fans’ fears and keep conspiracy theories at bay.</p><p>“They kept it airtight, they didn’t let nothing out, they protected me.”</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=655 data-injectable=true>Many of his famous friends saw the post, and offered kind words and excitement to see his face and to know that he’s on the road to recovery. The Rock — who was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> by Foxx 5 years ago for Thrillist — commented, “I’m gonna bear hug the [expletive] outta you when I see you again 🐻 ❤️”</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>Day Shift co-star and Real Housewife Kandi Burruss offered a sweet, “I am sooooo glad to see you smile!

We certainly hope that he continues to recover, and that he will be back on our screens soon.
