After years of war, Geronimo finally surrendered to U.S. troops in 1886. While he became a celebrity, he spent the last two decades of his life as a prisoner of war.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A legend of the untamed American frontier, the Apache leader Geronimo was born in June 1829 in No-Doyohn Canyon, Mexico. He was a naturally gifted hunter, who, the story goes, as a boy swallowed the heart of his first kill to ensure a lifetime of success on the chase.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Being on the run certainly defined Geronimo's way of life. He belonged to the smallest band within the Chiricahua tribe, the Bedonkohe. Numbering a little more than 8,000, the Apaches were surrounded by enemies — not just Mexicans, but also other tribes, including the Navajo and Comanches.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Raiding their neighbors was also a part of the Apache life. In response, the Mexican government put a bounty on Apache scalps, offering as much as $25 for a child's scalp. But this did little to deter Geronimo and his people. At the age of 17, Geronimo had already led four successful raiding operations.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this same time, Geronimo fell in love with a woman named Alope. The two married and had three children together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, tragedy struck when he was out on a trading trip and Mexican soldiers attacked his camp. Word of the ransacking soon reached the Apache men. Quietly that night, Geronimo returned home, where he found his mother, wife and three children all dead.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Warrior Leader</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The murders devastated Geronimo. In the tradition of the Apache, he set fire to his family's belongings and then, in a show of grief, headed into the wilderness to bereave the deaths. There, it is said, alone and crying, a voice came to Geronimo that promised him: "No gun will ever kill you. I will take the bullets from the guns of the Mexicans … and I will guide your arrows."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Backed by this sudden knowledge of power, Geronimo rounded up a force of 200 men and hunted down the Mexican soldiers who killed his family. It went on like this for 10 years, as Geronimo exacted revenge against the Mexican government.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Beginning in the 1850s, the face of his enemy changed. Following the end of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/mexican-american-war/mexican-american-war data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mexican-American War" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Mexican-American War</a> in 1848, the United States took over large tracts of territory from Mexico, including areas belonging to the Apache. Spurred by the discovery of gold in the Southwest, settlers and miners streamed into their lands. Naturally, tensions mounted and the Apaches stepped up their attacks, which included brutal ambushes on stagecoaches and wagon trains.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But the Chiricahua leader, Geronimo's father-in-law, Cochise, could see where the future was headed. In an act that greatly disappointed his son-in-law, the revered chief called a halt to his decade-long war with the Americans and agreed to the establishment of a reservation for his people on a prized piece of Apache property.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But within just a few years, Cochise died, and the federal government reneged on its agreement, moving the Chiricahua north so that settlers could move into their former lands. This act only further incensed Geronimo, setting off a new round of fighting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Geronimo proved to be as elusive as he was aggressive. However, authorities finally caught up with him in 1877 and sent him to the San Carlos Apache reservation. For four long years, he struggled with his new reservation life, finally escaping in September 1881.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Out on his own again, Geronimo and a small band of Chiricahua followers eluded American troops. Over the next five years, they engaged in what proved to be the last of the Indian wars against the United States.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Perceptions of Geronimo were nearly as complex as the man himself. His followers viewed him as the last great defender of the Native American way of life. But others, including fellow Apaches, saw him as a stubborn holdout, violently driven by revenge and foolishly putting the lives of people in danger.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With his followers in tow, Geronimo shot across the Southwest. As he did, the seemingly mystical leader was transformed into a legend as newspapers closely followed the Army's pursuit of him. At one point nearly a quarter of the Army's forces — 5,000 troops — were trying to hunt him down.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Finally, in the summer of 1886, he surrendered, the last Chiricahua to do so. Over the next several years Geronimo and his people were bounced around, first to a prison in Florida, then a prison camp in Alabama and then Fort Sill in Oklahoma. In total, the group spent 27 years as prisoners of war.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Final Years and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While he and the rest of the Chiricahua remained under guard, Geronimo experienced a bit of celebrity from his white former enemies. Less than a decade after he'd surrendered, crowds longed to catch a glimpse of the famous Indian warrior. In 1905, he published his autobiography, and that same year he received a private audience with President Theodore Roosevelt, unsuccessfully pressing the American leader to let his people return to Arizona.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His death came four years later. While riding home in February 1909, he was thrown from his horse. He survived a night out in the cold, but when a friend found him the next day, Geronimo's health was rapidly deteriorating. He passed away six days later, with his nephew at his side.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"I should never have surrendered," Geronimo, still a prisoner of war, said on his deathbed. "I should have fought until I was the last man alive."</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=28 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Geronimo</li><li>Birth Year: 1829</li><li>Birth City: No-Doyohn Canyon</li><li>Birth Country: Mexico</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Geronimo was a Bedonkohe Apache leader of the Chiricahua Apache, who led his people's defense of their homeland against the military might of the United States.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>War and Militaries</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1909</li><li>Death date: February 17, 1909</li><li>Death State: Oklahoma</li><li>Death City: Fort Sill</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=31><ul data-node-id=33 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Geronimo Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/political-figures/geronimo</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: March 26, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGinqKSZqbakrctmnaKfpaeytHvGnqmoppmivA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
