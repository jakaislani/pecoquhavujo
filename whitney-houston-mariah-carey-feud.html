She’s a superstar and a great vocalist.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But when Carey’s self-titled 1990 debut album sold 15 million copies globally, compared to Houston’s third album I’m Your Baby Tonight selling a very respectable five million in the same year, the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/musics-30-fiercest-feuds-and-beefs-253226/mariah-carey-vs-whitney-houston-119782/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="direct comparisons" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">direct comparisons</a> began, sparking what came to be one of the greatest music rivalries of all time.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The press constantly pitted Houston against Carey</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">What started out as a press-born battle, became real when Houston was asked in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia3PRlOAwk8" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="European interview" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">European interview</a>, “What do you think of her?” and replied with a snark, “What do I think of her? I don’t think of her.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The comment was met with yelps from the crowd so impassioned that her following comment of “Musically, I think she’s a good singer,” was quickly ignored.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The battle for the top of the charts seemed to fuel their supposed rivalry. When Carey’s “One Sweet Day” knocked Houston’s “Exhale (Shoop Shoop)” off the charts, Houston was again asked her thoughts, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/musics-30-fiercest-feuds-and-beefs-253226/mariah-carey-vs-whitney-houston-119782/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="this time on MTV" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">this time on MTV</a>: “Maybe it’s not what I think, it’s what she thinks — it’s more important.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For her part, Carey seemed to always take the backseat as the newcomer, even when she was a bonafide chart-topper and deserving diva. In fact, when the idea for the two to come together for a duet, Carey <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia3PRlOAwk8" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="admitted to MTV" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">admitted to MTV</a> that her first thought was, “Did she say that was cool?”</p><img alt="Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston" title="Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston" width=2204 height=1636 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/msdprof_ec041.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Courtesy Everett Collection</span><p>Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston recording "When You Believe"</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The singers shut down the rumors when they recorded a duet together, which won an Oscar</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the heights of the supposed rivalry, Dreamworks’ Jeffrey Katzenberg talked to both singers about his upcoming animated film Prince of Egypt, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.mtv.com/news/1426947/mariah-talks-about-whitney-duet-takes-stage-with-jermaine-dupri-and-da-brat/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Carey told MTV" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Carey told MTV</a> in 1998. In a move that shocked the pop culture world, the two stepped into the studio together to record the 1998 movie’s title song, “When You Believe” — sharing meaningful lyrics like, “There can be miracles / When you believe.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It’s sort of a message song,” Carey said. “If we were ever going to come together on any kind of record, this is definitely the right one — and really the coolest thing to me is that after all that drama and everybody making it like we had a rivalry, she was just really cool and we had a really good time in the studio.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Squashing the rumors all together, she added: “We had fun and so, if nothing else, it was a good experience and diva-ism, whatever.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And if that show of friendship wasn’t enough, the pair appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show together on November 25, 1998, bemused by the way the press and public had convinced them that they were rivals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“When we got together, it was like magic,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.oprah.com/own-oprahshow/mariah-carey-and-whitney-houston-shut-down-rumors-that-theyre-rivals data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Houston told Winfrey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Houston told Winfrey</a>. “We clicked, we laughed like old girlfriends.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"When You Believe" went on to win an Academy Award in 1999 for Best Song.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Houston and Carey even mocked their rivalry</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Houston and Carey continued their tour of friendship at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards, where they showed up from opposite sides of the stage to present the award for Best Male Video together — both wearing the same brown dress.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Nice dress,” Carey said as they looked each other up and down. Houston replied, “You look pretty good too.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“That’s one-of-a-kind, huh?” Carey egged on, while Houston replied, “That’s what they told me.” Mockingly annoyed with the situation, Carey did a quick change, tearing away a part of her long gown revealed a shorter hemline: “Fortunately, I come prepared for situations like this.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Of course, Houston followed, revealing a slightly different cut, but equally stunning, dress, as they showered each other with compliments. “That’s a page-turner,” Carey said to Houston, who replied, “No, you look good!” They sealed the bit with a hug.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The two repeated the coordination by wearing white gowns when they performed “When You Believe” together at the 1999 Academy Awards.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The rivalry was reignited in the press a decade later</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While that should have sealed the deal on any further talk of feuds, any opportunity to create parallels between their individually successful careers always became exaggerated.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2009, when Houston moved the release date of her album I Look to You one day, from September 1 to August 31, it was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.today.com/id/32598245/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/whitney-vs-mariah-divas-back-ring/#.Xj3SchdKg_U data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="seen as a symbolic gesture" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">seen as a symbolic gesture</a> since Carey had pushed her album Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel from August 25 to September 15 and eventually September 29. One seemed uber prepared while the other seemed to not be able to get it together in time.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Carey called Houston 'one of the greatest of all time'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following the untimely death of Houston just before the Grammy Awards on February 11, 2012, Carey has shown nothing but respect for her fellow singer-turned-friend, attending her funeral in Newark, New Jersey.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Looking back, Carey points to the imagined rivalry as a societal issue. “What has to change in our industry the most… is the pitting of women against each other,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1420075844827231" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she told Variety" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she told Variety</a> in 2019. “We didn’t know each other — and she was one of the greatest of all time. And then we finally did a duet together that won an Oscar. We had the best time working together. It was female camaraderie. We both got it. We were like she doesn’t hate me. We’re actually having a great time together and this is more fun than I have working alone, ever. So I think camaraderie with women you respect is a huge deal.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She echoed that sentiment while <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8546655/mariah-carey-interview-career-moments-whitney-houston data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="talking to " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">talking to </a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8546655/mariah-carey-interview-career-moments-whitney-houston data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Billboard class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Billboard</a>: “Working with Whitney was an experience I'll never forget. It was a bonding experience...we really put all the rumors and nonsense behind us that there was a feud.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I don’t think people could ever really understand our relationship,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5lB3qgx2QU" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Carey told Good Morning America" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Carey told Good Morning America</a>. “There was always this supposed rivalry in the beginning and then we did the duet and became friends and I saw her toward the end and I loved her... her legend’s going to go on forever.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJorqGhpKOyunnHqKysrJ%2Bjeq6t0aKYoWWTlr%2BmxYyfnK6c</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
