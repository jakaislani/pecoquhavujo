Not everyone agrees with me, of course — the contentious nature of Love is Blind is one of its selling points, after all — but I’m <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">firmly in Camp Johnie</a>, and you can’t budge me.</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>As such, I was keyed into Love is Blind TikTok — and social media in general — from the very start, and quickly saw anti-Stacy content flood my feeds. Much of this content was poking fun at Stacy’s materialistic nature, makeup use, and bullying behavior, but some additionally teased her over her career. With all the things Stacy has stacked up against her, her job hardly seems notable, but let’s still take a look at this “operations manager.”</p><h2 id=h-what-is-stacy-s-job data-injectable=false>What is Stacy’s job?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Stacy Snyder (@stacyrenae926)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=716 data-current-count=1016 data-injectable=true>Love is Blind introduces viewers to a lot of love seekers over the course of each season, so it helpfully provides a caption with their name and a quick description of their job. For <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lydia</a>, that equals a caption noting her work as a geologist, for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor it’s her teaching</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stacy’s job is clearly stated</a> across the season as “operations manager.” Apart from that, however, Stacy’s job rarely comes up. It’s clear that she has high expectations when it comes to money and her desire to be pampered often comes with a high price tag – despite the show’s promise to help participants find love “not for your looks, your race, your background, or your income.”</p><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>But, as long as Stacy can bankroll that opulent lifestyle for herself, who are we to judge? She has every right to spend her money however she wants — living that first-class lifestyle — but, when it becomes Izzy’s responsibility, it becomes an issue. That responsibility seemingly falls on Izzy not because Stacy doesn’t have money — its clear, in the show, that she comes from generational wealth — but because her job doesn’t actually pay that well, and she doesn’t want her father to bankroll her life.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Operations manager sounds good on paper, but it doesn’t actually seem to align with what we see Stacy doing for a living in Love is Blind season 5. The one shot we get of Stacy at work, she’s teaching a pilates class over at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Method Pilates in Houston</a>. Pilates instructor and operations manager aren’t the same thing, so where’s the disconnect?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Stacy_pilateslove-is-blind.jpg><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>As it turns out, pilates is only one of Stacy’s jobs. That “operations manager” appears to come from her work with Petromar, a company that, on her LinkedIn, lists “global feedstock brokering” under its logo. Rumors that this company belongs, at least in part, to Stacy’s father may be true, but there’s no real confirmation of that fact. Her father appears to work in the oil industry, and — while tracking down her actual company is a challenge — it does appear that Stacy’s job isn’t entirely nepotism-based.</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>That’s on top of the final job <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stacy lists on her LinkedIn</a>. On top of her work at Method Pilates and Petromar, she also bills herself as the founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Closet Audit</a>, a company that rearranges, styles, and streamlines closets to help people improve their look. The company’s only been around since 2022, and it’s hard to say how well it’s doing, but it likely adds at least some income to Stacy’s bank account.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>So there you have it. I’m by no means her biggest fan, but it seems Stacy wasn’t actually referencing pilates when listing herself as an operations manager. Whether that actual title was one earned through her father’s good name or Stacy’s own hard work has yet to be fully revealed, but it’s one less tick in the anti-Stacy column.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZpuonaNiwLWtwrJkn6qfonqtu9WeZKKrXZe5qrrDZpuoZZakv26tjKWgr6GenHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
