And for me to protect myself, I always said I didn’t wanna have kids, I don’t wanna have kids, because I didn’t wanna be pregnant and go to the doctor again [and] just, like, know that I didn’t have a heartbeat. That was rough.”</p><p>Also read&nbsp;<a href=#>The Ultimatum alum April Marie and boyfriend Cody Cooper are officially a parent!</a></p><p>Share this</p><strong>Disclaimer Statement</strong>: Married Biography's editors wrote and updated all of this data based on their best knowledge and understanding. <a href=#>Married Biography</a> does not guarantee these opinions or ideas.
