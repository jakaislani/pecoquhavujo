The rumored contract terminations, explained</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p data-characters=274 data-injectable=true data-video=true>On Nov. 25,&nbsp;news broke out that BlockBerry Creative would be terminating its contract with <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LOONA</a></strong>‘s Chuu, following a panoply of situations that led to her removal from the South Korean girl group, including accusations of staff mistreatment and violent language.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>LOONA, which has been active since 2016, consists of eleven members — formerly twelve — and they are currently one of the biggest all-female acts in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">K-Pop</a>. The group was formed under the Blockberry Creative label, and they have currently over 50 physical albums under their name, including single albums, EPs, and subunit records. The group was also named the new ambassador of Korean culture abroad in 2021, furthering the group’s increasing popularity.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>Due to their global success, LOONA’s controversies behind the scenes are completely shaking the music world of K-Pop, and here’s what’s happening.</p><h2 id=h-why-was-loona-s-chuu-removed-from-the-group data-injectable=false>Why was LOONA’s Chuu removed from the group?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Loona-chuu.jpg><p data-characters=648 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>As per the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official statement by Blockberry Creative</a>, Chuu’s “violent language and misuse of power toward [the] staff,” made up the reasoning behind the singer’s removal from the former 12-member group. Just a few months prior, the company had also put out a statement denying Chuu’s rumors of transferring to another agency. Immediately after the announcement, netizens quickly jumped on the bandwagon and took to social media to place their targeted criticism. Fans shared their thoughts regarding the agency’s decision, accusing BlockBerry of covering their own agenda after Chuu publicly criticized the company.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>In March 2022, South Korean media outlet&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikitree</a>&nbsp;affirmed, through an exclusive report, that Chuu had filed a lawsuit against Blockberry, urging them to suspend her contract. According to the report by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Korea JoongAng Daily</a>, Chuu allegedly had ‘partially’ won that lawsuit against her company.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/VideoScreenshot-YouTube-MVLOONAChuuHeartAttack-246.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1610062717-eng-teaser-0-14-screenshot.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/VideoScreenshot-YouTube-MVLOONAChuuHeartAttack-211-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LOONA_3-696x391-1.jpg><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>The allegations against the company did not end there. While at the South Korean talk show Dr. Oh’s Golden Clinic, Chuu admitted that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she had not received an income in 2021</a>, immediately alerting fans to the possibility that the company might not have been paying the members. All the accusations against the management agency led many fans to believe Blockberry released the official statement accusing Chuu of bullying to cover up the allegations made by the singer.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>On Nov.28, Chuu finally commented on the situation through her personal Instagram account, where she posted a statement ensuring that she “[has] never done anything that will make [her] fans ashamed.” She also took the time to thank the fans who have stood up for her, regardless of any accusations.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>LOONA’s contract terminations</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/loona-1.jpg><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>According to a report shared by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JTBC’s Entertainment News</a> on Nov.28, nine members of LOONA — HeeJin, HaSeul, YeoJin, Kim Lip, JinSoul, Choerry, Yves, Go Won, and Olivia Hye — had filed provisional injunctions requesting for their exclusive contracts with BlockBerryCreative to be suspended as of 2022. These injunction requests would exclude HyunJin and ViVi.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>The reasoning behind the injunctions was allegedly the member’s lack of trust in their agency. This would mean that any future activities between the group and Blockberry Creative would prove to be difficult, and for this reason, it would justify ending the contracts in the near future.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Blockberry Creative<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> has since denied all allegations</a> that nine of the members from LOONA had filed provisional injunctions, in addition to requesting that former member Chuu presents all evidence pointing towards her innocence if she wishes to clear out her name.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Blockberry Creative Tax Evasion</h2><p data-characters=674 data-current-count=937 data-injectable=true>Several fans have brought light to Blockberry Creative’s disreputable actions behind the scenes. According to the information database run by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korea’s National Tax Service</a>, co-CEO&nbsp;Lee Jong Myung, owner of a business called ‘Ilkwang Silver Care Center,’ is listed as having evaded approximately 30 billion KRW (around $22.5 million USD) in taxes since 2003.&nbsp;On a similar note, the same company’s COO&nbsp;Lee Kyu Tae is listed for evading approximately 19.9 billion KRW ($15 million USD) in taxes since 2004. On the same website, both CEOS are publicly listed as&nbsp;“high-income&nbsp;tax evaders,” allegedly proving their lack of transparency.</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Tax evasion is an incredibly serious offense in South Korea, which provides a reason for those who believe Blockberry Creative engages in questionable acts against the entertainers listed under the company. For this reason, many fans believe that these actions further the suspicion that the allegations against former LOONA member Chuu are completely false as they continuously attempt to evade any allegations made against the company.</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=false>K-Pop agencies provide some of the most powerful names in the entertainment industry, and for this reason, it becomes particularly difficult to provide strong evidence against such powerful household names. While it is unsure how this situation will hold, many believe that LOONA might disband in the near future. Chuu’s future, however, is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored</a> to be in the hands of BY4M Studio, the singer’s new alleged management agency.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn5qsXZ7AbrTAqaeeppmjtG7DyK2fZqSfpLuiedOhnGaqpaK8s7HDZpqopqSnrqTAjK2cq6WZo661tc6nqmadqKW5orXNnpto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
