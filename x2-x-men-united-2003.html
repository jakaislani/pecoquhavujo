Of course there will be audience members who believe mutants should have no rights, and so "X2" provides a valuable civics lesson. (How you register a mutant who can teleport or shape-shift is not explained.) Perhaps not coincidentally, the movie has a president who looks remarkably like <a href=#>George W. Bush</a>. The film opens with one of its best scenes, as a creature with a forked tail attacks the White House and whooshes down corridors and careens off walls while the Secret Service fires blindly. The creature's purpose is apparently to give mutants a bad name, inspiring still more laws undermining their rights.</p><p>Despite all of the havoc and carnage of the first film, just about everybody is back for the sequel. Amazing, that they weren't all killed. Charles Xavier (<a href=#>Patrick Stewart</a>) still runs his private school for young mutants, Magneto (<a href=#>Ian McKellen</a>) still plots against him, and there is a new villain named Gen. William Stryker (<a href=#>Brian Cox</a>) who is assigned by the government to deal with the mutant threat and uses the turncoat mutant Yuriko (<a href=#>Kelly Hu</a>) on his team.</p><p>The principal mutants are, in credits order, Wolverine (<a href=#>Hugh Jackman</a>), who has blades that extend from his knuckles; Storm (<a href=#>Halle Berry</a>), who can control the weather; Dr. Jean Grey (<a href=#>Famke Janssen</a>), whose power of telekinesis is growing stronger; Cyclops (<a href=#>James Marsden</a>), whose eyes shoot laser beams; Mystique (<a href=#>Rebecca Romijn-Stamos</a>), a shape-shifter whose shapes are mostly delightful; Nightcrawler (<a href=#>Alan Cumming</a>), the teleporter who attacked the White House; Iceman (<a href=#>Shawn Ashmore</a>), who can cool your drink and lots of other things; Pyro (<a href=#>Aaron Stanford</a>), who can hurl flames but needs a pilot light, and Rogue (<a href=#>Anna Paquin</a>), who can take on aspects of the personalities around her.</p><p>These superpowers are so oddly assorted that an X-Men adventure is like a game of chess where every piece has a different move. Some of the powers are awesome; Storm stops an aerial pursuit by generating tornadoes with her mental powers, and Dr. Jean Grey is able to restart an airplane in mid-air.</p><p>Odd, then, that Wolverine is one of the dominant characters even though his X-Acto knuckles seem pretty insignificant compared to the powers of Pyro or Cyclops. In a convention borrowed from martial arts movies, "X2" pairs characters with matching powers, so that when Wolverine has his titanic battle, it's with an enemy also equipped with blades. What would happen if Pyro and Iceman went head to head? I visualize the two of them in a pool of hot water.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46xaWawXaKyr3nUp6CtnZRif3F8kg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
