"We spent a few years up North in, like, Solvang, Santa Barbara, area, but ... I lived everywhere. The East Coast, the South, UK, Europe, the Middle East, like, we grew up everywhere," she revealed.</p><p dir=ltr>According to a 2017 interview with <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, Paris was home-schooled.
