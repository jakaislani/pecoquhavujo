Soon, the entire planet will have a chance to see the Von Erich Family’s story on the silver screen, and MJF had something to do with that.</p><p>MJF has a role in the upcoming The Iron Claw film. In the upcoming Iron Claw biopic, the current AEW World Champion takes on the role of Lance Von Erich. While MJF is undeniably one of AEW’s most prominent stars, his appearance in the film might not immediately catch your eye. <a href=#>Some fans were bit disappointed to hear that MJF doesn’t get a ton of screen time</a>.</p><p>MJF is still an executive producer on The Iron Claw film. The <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a> revealed that the Salt of the Earth received that credit thanks to all the input he had with the wrestling side of filming.</p><p>MJF’s Executive Producer role in the “Iron Claw” movie was because he was asked and gave a lot of input into the wrestling aspects of the movie</p><p>The Iron Claw provides an in-depth exploration of the Von Erich wrestling family’s lives and the many tragedies they faced. MJF’s story as Lance Von Erich may not be a focal point, but his contributions will be seen in other ways.</p><p>Chavo Guerrero Jr, who has become the guy Hollywood calls if they want to do a pro wrestling scene correctly, was also heavily involved with the project. He wrestled several matches with Zac Efron as he prepared for the role of Kevin Von Erich. MJF didn’t need any tips with how to work in the ring, but he was also around to provide lots of feedback.</p><p>The Iron Claw is poised to be an important film for pro wrestling fans. We can only hope that they are able to do the fantastic, and tragic, story of the Von Erich Family justice. MJF certainly did his best to make sure of that.</p><p>What’s your take on MJF’s role on The Iron Claw?

These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX90e5BqZmtsX6y1unnMo51mqpWYsqrCxJ1knrCVmMK1tdWeZKmqn5nCpLHRZpqrnZSewW67zWaroZ1dnr%2Bwuoyco5qvXZu2rbmO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
