But even Wade Wilson struggled to recover from what Fox did to him in 2009’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a>. The film took the Merc with a Mouth, famed for his wisecracks and jokes and uh, sewed his mouth shut. Fans were aghast and to this day it’s considered one of the stupidest adaptations of a superhero on the big screen.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>But one puzzle is why Ryan Reynolds agreed to play the character like this. He’d been attached to a Deadpool solo film since the mid-2000s, saying he’d opened a 2004 comic to see Wilson describing himself as looking like “Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar Pei” and realized it was his destiny to play him.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>In an interview, he explained that he even knew they were butchering the character while making the movie, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recounting his conversation with the producers</a>.</p><p>“I said, ‘You guys, people are gonna go nuts over this.’ And he was like, ‘I know right?” And I was like, ‘No, not in a good way.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Marvels-Midnight-Sons-Deadpool-DLC-20230130134320_1-75.jpg><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>So, why did he take the part, then? Well, he realized that Fox was going to put Deadpool in the film with or without him and if the pic was a hit (which everyone assumed it’d be given the success of the first three X-Men movies), that actor would then be associated with the role. So, Reynolds had to buckle down, have the mouth-covering makeup slathered on and get through it.</p><p>“I was already attached to the&nbsp;Deadpool&nbsp;movie. We hadn’t, at that point, written a script yet. But that came along, and [I was basically told], ‘Play Deadpool in this movie, or else we’ll get someone else to.’ And I just said, ‘I’ll do it, but it’s the wrong version.’”</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>He later got his revenge by mercilessly mocking the movie in Deadpool, but we’re lucky that the story has a happy ending, as X-Men Origins: Wolverine almost killed the prospect of a solo film for the antihero altogether.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The R-rated</a> <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadpool 3</a> </strong>is currently in development with Bob’s Burgers&nbsp;writers&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin on script duties</a>. It looks as if we’ll be waiting until summer 2023 for the Merc to return, but hey, at least he’ll have a mouth!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9GymKdloprGr7vLnapmnailuaK1zaxkmp%2BimrKlec%2BlmLJllJqupbzOqKNmsJ2au2670aKeoqajYsSwuNWeqaKmlWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
