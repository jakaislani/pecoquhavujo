How true this is for Fr. Huard today.”Born in 1955 in Duluth, Minnesota, Huard attended The Saint Paul Seminary and was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis in 1994. He also served as parochial vicar of All Saints Parish in Lakeville (1994-1997), chaplain of the Community of Christ the Redeemer in West St. Paul (1996-1999), director of campus ministry at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul (1999-2007) and pastor of St. Mark Parish in St. Paul (2007-2009).Huard was a proud member of the Companions of Christ priestly fraternity association, and for a time served as its moderator.Funeral arrangements for Fr.
