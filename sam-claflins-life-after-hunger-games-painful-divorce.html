The shared statement read, "We will move forward with nothing but love, friendship, and a deep respect for one another whilst we continue to raise our family together."&nbsp;</p><p>While the former couple has continued to co-parent their two children, Claflin has expressed the negative impact that the separation has had on him. "[Divorce is] a horrendous thing to go through," he told <a href=#>GQ</a> in 2023. "Every break-up is difficult, and obviously having kids makes it even more. During [COVID-19], I really f***ing struggled with the kids and, mentally, where my life was." But being the actor that he is, he has channeled his emotions to not only help him branch into new roles, but also dive deeper into them.&nbsp;</p><p>An example of this creative expansion is in his role as Billy Dunne in "Daisy Jones and the Six," in which he played a rock star that goes through marital issues. "These emotions are still quite raw for me," he shared with GQ. "I can just take from that and put myself in this situation because I lived through it."</p><p>If you or someone you know needs help with mental health, please contact the <a href=#>Crisis Text Line</a> by texting HOME to 741741, call the <a href=#>National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264), or visit the <a href=#>National Institute of Mental Health website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampka4Nxgo6smKZlk6Gup7jIp6pmpJmbsm6txa2cq2WYqruosdFmnpqllah6sa3Ip52upF2Ztre70ZycaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
