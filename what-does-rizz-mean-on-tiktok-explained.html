Explained</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p data-characters=332 data-injectable=true data-video=true>Every generation has new slang becoming part of the daily lexicon. Gen X brought us Dude and Bogus. Millennials gave us Adulting and Feels. Now, we’re watching Gen Z creating new slang in real-time thanks to social media like <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a></strong>. Easily the most popular slang right now on the app is Rizz. But what exactly does Rizz mean?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>It seems like everyone is debating exactly who has Rizz and who doesn’t, yet it’s not 100% clear exactly what someone with Rizz looks like. But the more you dive into the Rizz videos on TikTok, it becomes clear it’s not too far off from words like Swag or Fresh of past generations. Don’t think it has an identical definition though, because having Rizz goes deeper than being cool or hip.</p><h2 id=h-what-does-rizz-mean-on-tiktok data-injectable=false>What does “Rizz” mean on TikTok?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tiktok2.jpg><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=754 data-injectable=true>The word “rizz” has social media star Kai Cenat to thank for its popularization. The YouTuber and Twitch streamer started using the word during his streams to describe his skills when hitting on women. He also created a series called the “Rizz Academy” back in 2021, when he posted a video called “KAI CENAT OPENS RIZZ ACADEMY”. The lengthy video showcases Cenat teaching a class of students how to improve their rizz.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Similarly, when you look up the word rizz on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Urban Dictionary</a>, it explains that rizzing a woman means you’re spitting game and successfully winning her over. Men who are really good at winning over women would be seen as a “professional rizzer”. Even some of the entries on Urban Dictionary reiterate that Cenat coined the term across his various social media channels.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who decides who has “Rizz” and who doesn’t?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true><a title=@ashis.t1ps href=#>@ashis.t1ps</a><p>i miss u guys sm after loosing all 965 people . <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=ashleyst1ps href=#>#ashleyst1ps</a> <a title=ashist1ps href=#>#ashist1ps</a> <a title=pickupline href=#>#pickupline</a> <a title=rizz href=#>#rizz</a> <a title=foru href=#>#foru</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=blowup href=#>#blowup</a></p><a title="♬ White Tee - Summer Walker & NO1-NOAH" href=#>♬ White Tee – Summer Walker & NO1-NOAH</a></figure><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>While Cenat is a large part of why the word is famous, he’s far from the only person on social media using it. The term has picked up steam on TikTok, with many people chiming in on what exactly someone with rizz looks like. While the answer vary from person to person, the common theme is charming the person you’re trying to pick up. But don’t worry: even if you don’t have rizz, the Internet’s favorite Marvel actor Tom Holland is proud of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his lack of rizz</a>. So you’re in good company.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>The other big question is whether or not girls can have rizz as well. While the examples of girls being rizz gods aren’t as popular, a lot of girls are making it clear what having rizz looks like. Some girls are even giving pointers, showing their own rizz-filled pick up lines that they claim should woo whatever girl you’re looking for.</p><h2 id=h-rizz-cap-and-more-gen-z-slang data-injectable=false>“Rizz”, “Cap” and more Gen Z slang</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tiktok.jpeg><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>“Rizz” may be the most recent example of Gen Z slang taking over TikTok but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s far from the first</a>. Ever since the app launched in 2017, it’s been filled with plenty of lingo that has a new generation of adults confused. Even now, there’s other slang that’s becoming more and more popular, filling For You pages.</p><p data-characters=527 data-current-count=876 data-injectable=true>You may have seen skits of girls or guys pretending to be “pick me” types. Those people who fall into this category are those who pretend like they’re “not like the others” and are desperate for the attention of the opposite sex. So much so, they’ll belittle other people of the same sex and say derogatory things about others just to seem like the best option for their crush. This skit below from Riri Bichri really nails the overall demeanor and attitude of “pick me” people.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@riribibi_ href=#>@riribibi_</a><p>i know this one’s too much. i fully understand, but plz tiktok just let me post it <a title=pov href=#>#pov</a> <a title=pickme href=#>#pickme</a> <a title=quirky href=#>#quirky</a></p><a title="♬ Kiss Me - Sixpence None The Richer" href=#>♬ Kiss Me – Sixpence None The Richer</a></figure><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>If you think we’re lying about how bad “pick me” people are, you’re calling it a “cap.” While best known in the context of “Cap or No Cap” challenges on TikTok, the phrase is believed has AAVE (African American Vernacular English) origins. Specifically, many have claimed the song “No Cap” by rappers Young Thug and Future from 2017 is what <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">launched the word</a> into the mainstream lexicon.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>Even features on TikTok have become slang for many people. TikToking is a common verb used by people who are in the process of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">making a video</a> for the platform. If you see someone refer to something they saw on their FYP, they saw it on their “For You” page, the main feed on TikTok. As the app continues to grow in popularity, odds are it will continue to change the way we speak too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTArWSdp5WoerO12bNkpp2Ro3qwuoytoKSsn6B6psTPpZiippWZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
