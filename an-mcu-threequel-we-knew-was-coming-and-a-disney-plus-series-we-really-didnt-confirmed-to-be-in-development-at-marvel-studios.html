Naturally, even though Kevin Feige and company keep things as locked down as they possible can, we still hear rumblings about what the House of Ideas has cooking, and so news that a movie sequel and a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney Plus</a> series have officially entered development has now reached our ears.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=533 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>And, you know what, while one of them is not much of a surprise, the other very much is. According to the latest issue of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Production Weekly</a>, Marvel Studios is getting cracking on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Strange 3</a>. Considering that Multiverse of Madness came oh-so-close to crossing the coveted $1 billion mark at the box office in 2022, it’s not exactly a shock that Marvel’s cooking up a threequel for Benedict Cumberbatch’s sorcerer. Especially given the recent rumors about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the comic book event the film is potentially adapting</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness.jpg><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=821 data-injectable=true>On the other hand, the news that a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wiccan</a> TV series is in the works is a much bigger deal. Yes, it seems that WandaVision is getting yet another spinoff in the form of a show all about Billy Maximoff aka Young Avengers team member Wiccan. Joe Locke is rumored to be playing the part in Agatha: Coven of Chaos but this has yet to be announced by the studio at this time. We had previously received <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the barest whispers that such a series was occurring</a>, but now we know for certain a production with this title is underway.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>It’s important to note that these two projects are in the works, not shooting, so don’t expect them to get going in the immediate future. Still, at least we know they’re coming eventually. Doctor Strange 3 is believed to be secretly scheduled for 2026, but a Wiccan show would probably stream a lot sooner than that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKdlnZjCbsDHq5yeqaWauW7DxGaip52nYsSiv4ycpqahnpx6orrDZphmnJmou6bFjKmjrqtdqLKztcSsZLCdXaeyorjLsmSdoZSjwW6vzqedoqqdmrFuwM5mmZ5lmaN6pbHVnqOoqJ2au7V5wK1kppmiq7KtedKtrJ2hn6h8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
