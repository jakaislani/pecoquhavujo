Don was pulled away by event security after stomping Omega as part of the post-match attack when an individual appeared and grabbed Callis by the head/neck area, shoving him to the ground.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bryan Alvarez of The Wrestling Observer</a> reported that the person attacking Callis was not involved with the scheduled entertainment in any way and the attack caused Callis to be transported to a local medical facility to have himself treated. Callis was said to have suffered a concussed eardrum, busted mouth, and other neck injuries.</p><p>You can see video of the attack below. It happens in the upper left corner towards the end of the video.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>There have been rumors that a fan was the one that got involved, but this individual was the security guard that was not clued into the scripted fight between Omega and Callis. Callis is not believed to have been injured.</p><p>Update: <a href=#>Haus of Wrestling</a> reports that AAA booker Konnan noted that the attacker was a former security guard who was supposed to be visiting friends at the show. The individual then “marked out and got involved” when he saw action happening.</p><p>Per Konnan, the attacker almost choked Callis out, ripped his suit, and possibly twisted his ankle. The report noted that Callis is okay.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">READ MORE: NJPW G1 Climax 33 Night One Results (7/15): Will Ospreay And More</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJxbnFtaGKxsLqMnJilpJmoeqLA05qapJ2UYq6nwMSrZK2qmaW5prnAp6CaZaitxap506Khrpmelg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
