The woman is a piece of history — an immovable pillar of our childhoods. She’s the first Black woman in history to earn the EGOT, which makes her one of 18 people to have ever won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony Award. She’s joined by unmatched talent like Audrey Hepburn, Viola Davis, and Mel Brooks, and her status among them guarantees Goldberg’s position in history.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>With such a successful career behind her, Goldberg seems like she should be worth a few hundred million, at minimum. After all, the woman’ has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">graced our screens more than 100 times</a> — and that’s in film alone. She’s been in just as many television shows, a heaping handful of documentaries, and even a fair few theatre productions.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=766 data-injectable=true>She’s absolutely everywhere, and inching into her late 60s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t slowing the star down one bit</a>. She already appeared in one project in 2023 — and a thriller, no less — and another, Ezra, is slated to release in the next few months. That’s on top of another in-progress project slated for eventual release, which simply serves as more proof that Goldberg is an unstoppable force in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=h-whoopi-goldberg-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>Whoopi Goldberg’s net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Whoopi_Goldberg_net_worth1.jpg><p data-characters=605 data-current-count=905 data-injectable=true>With a resume as decorated as Goldberg’s, I, for one, would expect the 68-year-old to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">boast a bit more cash</a>. She’s worth plenty, don’t get me wrong, but with such a decorated career behind her, a laundry list of accolades a dozen deep, and a fanbase millions strong, it seems like she should easily outearn at least one of the Kardashians. She doesn’t quite manage to beat out any of the famous sisters — though she vastly outearns old forgotten Rob — but then <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Goldberg’s wealth is built on cultural moments</a> and unforgettable performances rather than expensive shapewear.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=false>They’re still worth hundreds of millions, however, while Goldberg happily assesses a net worth of around $60 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. That’s more than enough to live a nice cozy life, followed by a comfortable retirement, of course, but I can’t help but think — after the decades of classic, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved work she’s put out</a> — that our girl Whoopi is worth a few million more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZaedvLC8yGaeqKSUl7Kzs9JmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
