As Trevor Noah put it: it’s “bad b*tch o’clock.” <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lizzo</a></strong> just put on a spectacular show at the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2023 Grammy Awards</a></strong>, opening her performance with an a capella section of “About Damn Time” before going into a gospel choir-backed rendition of “Special.” The choir even launched into a mash-up of sorts, combining the two hit singles, before Lizzo finished her moving performance. The “About Damn Time” singer was wearing a black outfit with silver accents, complete with a large cross to fit in with her gospel chorus and we loved this look. As expected, Lizzo put on an excellent show and her performance is already a highlight of the ceremony.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=743 data-current-count=743 data-injectable=true>Lizzo added another Grammy to her collection tonight, winning Record of the Year for “About Damn Time.” Lizzo previously won big during the 2020 Grammy Awards, winning Best Urban Contemporary Album for the deluxe version of Cuz I Love You, best Pop Solo Performance for her hit song “Truth Hurts,” and Best Traditional R&B Performance for “Jerome.” Lizzo had been releasing quality music for years before the release of Cuz I Love You launched her into the mainstream, debuting at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. Her single “Truth Hurts” blew up in 2020 thanks to the power of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> (it being a bop didn’t hurt) and became her first number one single on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>The “Special” singer arrived at the ceremony in a stunning Dolce and Gabbana floral look, complete with a cape adorned with peach-colored roses. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One of our favorite red carpet looks of the night,</a> social media seemed to agree and fans celebrated the look in several corners of the internet.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lizzo (@lizzobeeating)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=593 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>Lizzo had a special 2022, releasing her hit single “About Damn Time” before the release of her fourth studio album Special. The single hit the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and Special earned Lizzo critical and commercial success. “About Damn Time” helped cement Lizzo as one of this generation’s biggest pop stars, showing the singer can release consistently good, chart-topping singles that make us want to get up and dance. Special was the singer’s highest-charting album and the highest-charting album by any female artist in 2022 at the time of release.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>In addition to her musical success, Lizzo recently won an Emmy for Lizzo’s Watch Out for the Big Grrrls. The Amazon Prime reality show followed 13 women competing for a spot as one of Lizzo’s dancers and won Outstanding Reality Program. With her Emmy and Grammy wins, Lizzo is ever closer to becoming a prestigious EGOT winner, only needing an Oscar and a Tony Award to earn the title.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=false>We hope Lizzo is celebrating her win with her boo <a href=#>Myke Wright</a>, who she happily introduced to the world just last night at Clive Davis’ pre-Grammy party. Congratulations to Lizzo and we can’t wait to see where her career goes next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8uisbOnXZmuu8bLnqpmr5mptW6%2F066lp6GenHqovsCmpLKrXaWys7LOq6SappOafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
