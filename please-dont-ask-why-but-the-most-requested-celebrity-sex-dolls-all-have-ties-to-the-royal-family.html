However, Princess Diana does, which is enough to make your stomach turn by giving it even the merest moment of thought.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Crown-princess-diana.jpg><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Unsurprisingly, or at least as predictable as a highly specific situation can get, Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton are the other two, because apparently funneling thousands upon thousands of dollars into a lifelike coital aid that bears a striking resemblance to a pair of high-profile Royal figures is something worth spending money on.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>If that wasn’t jaw-dropping enough in and of itself, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Post </a>has provided additional levels of incredulity after revealing that despite The Crown leading to an uptick in people demanding a Princess Diana sex doll, CEO of Inferno (the company that makes the queasy recreations) claims that his outfit would “never open ourselves up to accusations of cheapening her memory.”</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=false>If you’re making a sex doll of Princess Diana, then “cheapening her memory” doesn’t even begin to cover it, but if that’s how he wants to go down in the annals of history, then so be it. There’s a booming market for these sort of things, but who’d have thought that customers willing to part with their hard-earned cash would prove to be such staunch royalists?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S9rbHArJxmnJ%2BjwW6t0qRksKCpYq%2B2wIytn55lnaTAtXnRnqiunaOpsqV5wp6jnpqinsG6edKer2acn6G5tHnApaNmoJGrsm7AyJ6qZqyfYsGpsYyrprKZnGKzornIpbBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
